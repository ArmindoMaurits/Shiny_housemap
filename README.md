# Neighbourhood quality map
This project is build for an Data Science (IT) Minor course for the Hogeschool Rotterdam. The goal of our project was to make a neighbourhood quality map. The scope of this project was neighbourhood data from the city of Rotterdam, because that was publically available from [RotterdamOpenData](http://rotterdamopendata.nl/dataset). Other datasets have been retreived from the [Wijkprofiel](http://wijkprofiel.rotterdam.nl/nl/2016/rotterdam) website of the municipality of Rotterdam.

The starting page of this website gives the user an explanation on how to use this webapp and gives the user a selection of user profiles. These profiles differ from one another, because they check different categories and then show the user the map.
On this map people can also manually select or alter checkboxes to show different categories of data.
